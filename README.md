[Agile (Signum Framework)](http://www.signumframework.com/)
===================================================

Agile is a clone of Trello build with Signum Framework. It's much less polished 
but can be installed in a local server, avoiding data-privacy issues. 

In order to compile it you need Visual Studio 2013.
